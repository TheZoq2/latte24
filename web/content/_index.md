LATTE is a venue for discussion, debate, and brainstorming at the intersection of hardware acceleration and programming languages research. The core mission is to bring ideas we love from software programming languages and tools to the world of hardware design. For more details on the workshop's focus, see [the call for papers][cfp].

## Program Coming Soon

We have 17 accepted position papers, an exciting keynote, and a hands-on demo.
